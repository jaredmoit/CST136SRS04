Name : Jared Muralt

Issues:
It is difficult to determine if my distances are correct. Did a bunch of tests 
online and some agreed with my program and others didn't. Wesbites might not use the haversine formula.

Notes:
I chose to keep most class variables public because I don't think getters and setters are necessary for this.
I kept most of the GPS related stuff in one 'gps.h' file to make the porject less cluttered and make the include list smaller.
Just to make sure, I went through a map to make sure the sorting and distance calculations were accurate.

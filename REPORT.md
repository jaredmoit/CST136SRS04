Notes:
I chose to keep most class variables public because I don't think getters and setters are necessary for this.
I kept most of the GPS related stuff in one 'gps.h' file to make the proect less cluttered and make the include list smaller.
Just to make sure, I went through a map to make sure the sorting and distance calculations were accurate.
